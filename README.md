This project entailed the task of forecasting attendance at a baseball competition utilizing two datasets, namely the construction.csv for training and the production.csv for testing. The data cleaning process was approached with consideration to the production.csv and involved the removal of unnecessary features. Additionally, the project involved feature engineering, model development, and other relevant steps to successfully predict the attendance.
